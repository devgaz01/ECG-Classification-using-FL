Electrocardiograms (ECG) signal classification using Federated Learning
# Contributions
The contributions of this article can be summarized as follows:

(1) we significantly improve thresholds based on wavelet coeffi- cients.

(2) The improved thresholds to process the wavelet coefficients after the discrete decomposition, the wavelet inverted signal can be reconstructed more accurately.

(3) The improved threshold can be used to efficiently removethe noise wavelet coefficients and to retain more of the original signal wavelet coefficients.

(4) We design a federated learning based ECG signal classifier, which provides efficient classification of ECG signals and insures security and privacy of the data owners.

(5) We perform systematic simulation of the proposed method using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and show that the proposed method provides efficient de-noising and classifi- cation compared to the existing wavelet threshold methods.
